"The payment protocol (see BIP 70-72) will support attaching messages to transactions.

Note that these messages do not end up in the blockchain, which is the right way to do it, as they are private information between sender and receiver - no need to make the entire world replicate it."

Can we get this in the PIVX wallet? It will significantly help merchants with payments in environments that aren't naturally secure.

"Send 15 PIV with the message 'hoodie' to (PIV address or QR code) with your shipping address and you'll get 15% off!"

Something like that. It reminds of automatic texting applications that used to be popular in....like 2005. (Ask cha cha execpt you send a payment with it and get pizza)

This proposal has also been sent to the NAV community. You can track their progress using the following link:

A comment made by Prole on the NAV discord:
So effectively, the merchant specifies a URL that NavPay would query over TCP like
https://mystore.com/validate-discount-code?discountCode=NAVCOIN_RULES
and all NavPay would do is send the query and the merchant has to handle the rest
and then once it responds, navpay can make the payment
through the normal sending api to the navpay back end
the merchant site would need to respond with data we know something to do with like reduce the payment amount by X %
and we update the send amount
and make the payment

It should be noted that the messages should be encrypted and decrypted inside of the wallet app for privacy reasons.

Feel free to ask questions as I will be active on this issue.
